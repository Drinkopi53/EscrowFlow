# Performance-Triggered Smart Contract for Remote Work Bonuses

## Overview
This project implements a blockchain-based system to automate bonus payouts for remote work collaboration. It monitors performance metrics (e.g., GitHub commits, Trello and Jira task statuses), locks bonuses in an escrow, and releases funds automatically based on verified performance, enhancing trust and efficiency in remote teams.

## Features
- **Performance Monitoring:** Tracks GitHub commits, Trello tasks, and Jira issues via API integration.
- **Escrow Bonus:** Locks bonus in a smart contract on Polygon.
- **Automated Payout:** Releases bonus if performance targets are met, else returns funds to the contract owner.

## Tech Stack
- **Blockchain:** Polygon (EVM-compatible)
- **Smart Contract:** Solidity, Hardhat
- **Oracle:** Chainlink for API integrations with GitHub, Trello, and Jira
- **Frontend:** React.js, Tailwind CSS, MetaMask
- **Backend:** Node.js for API middleware

## Installation (MVP Placeholder)
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/project.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd project
   npm install
   ```
3. Configure environment variables:
   - Polygon Mumbai RPC URL
   - Chainlink node credentials
   - GitHub API token
4. Deploy smart contract:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network mumbai
   ```
5. Run frontend:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Usage
- **Setup Contract:** Use the UI to define bonus, KPI (e.g., 5 commits in 3 days), and deposit funds.
- **Monitor Performance:** View real-time commit data from GitHub, task statuses from Trello and Jira.
- **Receive Payout:** Bonus automatically sent to workerâ€™s wallet if targets are met.

## Documentation and Memory Bank
- Comprehensive and unambiguous documentation is maintained in the `memory-bank/` folder.
- The memory bank provides clear guidance on architecture, implementation plans, technology stack, and step-by-step instructions to ensure a strong foundation for development.

## Future Enhancements
- Enhanced integration with Trello and Jira APIs.
- Multi-metric performance tracking.
- Advanced UI with analytics and notifications.
